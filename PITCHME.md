### Questions We'll Answer

- What mentality should we have when we approach testing with React?
- What should our **unit tests** look like?
  - Are there other options outside of Enzyme? What is Enzyme? Why am I even here?
- What should our **integration tests** look like?
- How should we handle **end-to-end tests**?

## The Sad Fact

Testing in JavaScript isn't easy. We have to deal with:
- Async behavior (i.e. promises)
- The high degree of complexity with user interfaces
- Mocking external calls

Note:
It's just not as simple as the "black-box" testing scenarios in our Rails code.

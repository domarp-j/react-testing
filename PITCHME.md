### Questions We'll Answer

- What mentality should we have when we approach testing with React?
- What should our **unit tests** look like?
  - Are there other options outside of Enzyme? What is Enzyme? Why am I even here?
- What should our **integration tests** look like?
- How should we handle **end-to-end tests**?

- Async behavior (promises, API calls, etc)
- The high degree of complexity with user interfaces

It's just not as simple as "black box" testing

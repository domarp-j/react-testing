## React, Testing, and You
#### Pramod Jacob

### Questions We'll Answer

- What React best practices can we follow to make testing easier?
- What mentality should we have when we approach testing with React?
- How should we balance **unit tests**, **"integration" tests**, and **end-to-end tests**?

Note:
"Integration" in quotes because it's definition is super vague, esp in React. It could mean integration between components or integration with external systems.

---

### Testing in JavaScript and React Isn't Easy

- Async behavior (i.e. promises)
- The inherent complexity of user interfaces
- Handling external calls
- Complex component composition/hierarchy

Note:
- It's just not as simple as the "black-box" testing scenarios in our Rails code.
- How we compose our components will determine whether our tests are simple or complex

+++

### So How Can We Make Testing Easier?

- Understand a particular best practice for creating React components
- Understand the core principles of JavaScript and React testing
- Use the right testing tools for specific testing scenarios
- **Prefer testing behavior over focused logic**

Note:
That last point is applicable to all testing, not just JS/React

### Smart vs Dumb Components

+++

### Dumb Components

- Also called *presentational components*
- Deal completely with the look of components (elements, style, etc)
- Usually stateless and functional
- Usually not connected to any stores (Redux, Mobx, etc)

Note:
Addendum - can have some state pertaining to UI

+++

### Smart Components

- Also called *container components* or *logical components*
- Handle the UI logic - what to render, when, where, etc
- Usually stateful & class-based
- Usually connected to stores

Note:
Smart & dumb terminology kind of mean (Dan Abramov opposes it)
More memorable, however

+++?code=code/logicalComponent.js&lang=javascript&title=Smart Component: Example

@[9-12](Stateful)
@[6](Declared as a class)
@[1-32](Connected to a store)

+++?code=code/presentationComponent.js&lang=javascript&title=Dumb Component: Example

@[3](Just props, no state)
@[3](Declared as a function)
@[11](Not connected to any stores)

+++

Note:
ElisEvidenceUpload && FileUpload

This it not a hard & fast rule - this is just an ideal to strive for.

### I Have Smart & Dumb Components - Now What?

Note:
Or at least you've tried to separate them as much as possible.

+++

### I Have Smart & Dumb Components - Now What?

We think about testing!

### The React Testing Mentality: Component Contracts

+++

@quote["Understanding a componentâ€™s contract is the most important part of testing a React component. A contract defines the expected behavior of your component and what assumptions are reasonable to have about its usage."] - [The Right Way to Test React Components](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-right-way-to-test-react-components-548a4736ab22)

+++

### The React Testing Mentality: Component Contracts

- What does it render?
- What props does the component receive? How does it react to changes in props?
- What state does the component hold? How does it react to changes in state?
- When the user interacts with the component, what happens?

---

### Testing Renders

+++

This is where snapshot tests come in handy!

+++

@quote[Snapshot testing entails an admission of defeat in capturing the essential details of a component: instead we capture them all.] - [Visual Testing Handbook](https://www.chromaticqa.com/book/visual-testing-handbook)

+++

Does this mean you should never use snapshot tests?

+++

**No.** In fact, they can be extremely useful to test presentation components (if used properly).

Note:
Snapshot tests absolutely have their place in any React test suite, but be careful not to use them as a "cop out" test to boost your test coverage.
They are great for testing branching conditional scenarios in presentation components.

---

### Testing Props and State

+++

Avoid testing props and state directly. Instead, test the **reactions** of props and state changes.

Note:
Remember - we're testing behavior, not implementations

+++?code=code/fileUpload.js&lang=javascript

+++?code=code/fileDisplay.js&lang=javascript

+++?code=code/fileUploadTestNo.js&lang=javascript&title=Test Method 1 (Not Recommended)

Note:
Written in Jest and faux-Enzyme (real Enzyme coming later)
This isn't helpful because we don't know that the UI has reacted properly to a change in state

+++?code=code/fileUploadTestYes.js&lang=javascript&title=Test Method 2 (Recommended)

Note:
Written in Jest and faux-rtl (real rtl coming later)
This is much better because we are testing if the UI has reacted properly to a change in state

+++

The same ideas for testing state also applies to props

Note:
In fact, checking to see that a prop was passed is tantamount to testing the implementation of React

---

### Testing with Enzyme

- Directly tests the implementation of React components
-
- **An often painful experience**

---

### End to End Tests with Cypress

- ???

---

### The Overall Picture

---

### Other Useful React Testing Rules

- Don't test third-party libraries
- Don't test proptypes

Note:
- I don't think most people here will test third-party libraries directly - but be careful not to test them accidentally
- Testing proptypes is testing the implementation of a third-party library
